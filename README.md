# Advent of Code

These are my solutions and some notes on the same to the [Advent of Code][advent] event problems.

The event has been running since December, 2015. Since these are a sort of daily warm-up for me, it's all pretty rough. Years 2015 and 2017 are complete.

All puzzles (c) [Eric Wastl][eric].

Input files are encrypted, because I find it useful to have them handy and they should not be shared publically, as per the [FAQ][faq-input].

If you want the problem statements, then [check the website][advent]; it's not in the repo, [as per the FAQ][faq-problems].
